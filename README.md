# Real Estate Acquisition Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs various data analysis tasks on real estate acquisition data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries Used

- `os`
- `csv`
- `datetime`
- `collections`
- `statistics`
- `unittest`
- `typing`

All of these libraries are included in the Python Standard Library.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your command line and run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/valtterivalo/real_estate_acquisition.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
    
    ```
   cd real_estate_acquisition
   
3. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

    If not already installed in your local environment, you can install it by running:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   
4. **Open the Notebook**

    Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
    ```
   jupyter notebook
   
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `real_estate_acquisition.ipynb` file.

## Running the Code

1. **Run All Cells**
    
    Once the notebook is open, you can run all cells in the notebook by clicking **'Kernel' > 'Restart & Run All'**.

2. **Check the Output**

   After running all cells, you'll see the cell outputs populated below each cell. These should be read carefully for understanding the data analysis performed.

3. **Output Files**

   The notebook will generate output CSV files in the `output` folder within the same directory. These files contain various metrics calculated during the data analysis.
